# Task Manager with Authentication - Product Requirements Document

## Core Purpose & Success

**Mission Statement**: A secure, personal task management application that requires user authentication to protect individual task data and provide personalized productivity tracking.

**Success Indicators**: 
- Users can securely log in and access only their personal tasks
- Authentication state persists across browser sessions (24-hour expiry)
- Seamless integration with GitHub authentication for quick access
- Zero data leakage between different users

**Experience Qualities**: Secure, Personal, Streamlined

## Project Classification & Approach

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (authentication + task management with persistent state)

**Primary User Activity**: Creating and managing personal tasks with secure access control

## Essential Features

### Authentication System
- **Username/Password Login**: Traditional login with GitHub credentials validation
- **GitHub OAuth Integration**: One-click authentication using existing GitHub account
- **Session Management**: 24-hour session persistence with automatic expiry
- **Secure Logout**: Complete session termination and data clearing

### Task Management (Post-Authentication)
- **Personal Task Creation**: Add tasks tied to authenticated user
- **Task Status Management**: Toggle completion status securely
- **Task Organization**: Filter by all/active/completed with persistent state
- **Secure Task Deletion**: Remove tasks with proper authentication checks
- **Shared Task Viewing**: View tasks created by other users in read-only mode
- **Task Attribution**: Clear indication of task ownership and creation details

### Security Features
- **Session Validation**: Automatic session expiry and re-authentication prompts
- **Data Isolation**: Tasks are cleared on logout to prevent data access
- **Authentication Guards**: All task operations require valid authentication
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of authentication failures

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: The design should evoke trust, security, and personal control over data. Users should feel confident their information is protected while maintaining the clean, productive aesthetic of a modern task manager.

**Design Personality**: Professional, secure, and minimalist with subtle security indicators that don't overwhelm the interface.

**Visual Metaphors**: Clean lines, locked states, and clear user identity indicators that reinforce security without creating anxiety.

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with blue accent tones to convey trust and security

**Primary Color**: Deep blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 250)) - conveys trustworthiness and security
**Secondary Colors**: Light blue-gray tones for supporting elements
**Accent Color**: Bright blue (oklch(0.55 0.2 280)) - for authentication CTAs and active states
**Security Colors**: Subtle red for logout/destructive actions, green for successful authentication

**Foreground/Background Pairings**:
- Primary text on background: oklch(0.25 0.1 250) on oklch(0.98 0.01 250) - 13.1:1 contrast ✓
- Primary button text: oklch(1 0 0) on oklch(0.45 0.15 250) - 8.7:1 contrast ✓
- Muted text: oklch(0.5 0.08 250) on oklch(0.98 0.01 250) - 5.2:1 contrast ✓

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varied weights for hierarchy
**Primary Font**: Inter - clean, readable, and professional
**Typographic Hierarchy**: 
- Headers: 600-700 weight for prominence
- Body: 400-500 weight for readability
- Captions: 400 weight with muted colors

### UI Elements & Component Selection
**Authentication Components**:
- Modal dialogs for login forms to maintain context
- Clear primary buttons for authentication actions
- GitHub integration button with recognizable branding
- User avatar and profile display in header

**Security Indicators**:
- Logout button with clear destructive styling
- Session status indicators (subtle)
- Authentication-gated action feedback

### Animations
**Authentication Flow**: Smooth transitions between login and main app states
**Security Feedback**: Subtle animations for successful/failed authentication
**Session Management**: Gentle notifications for session expiry

## Implementation Considerations

### Security Requirements
- Session tokens stored securely in KV storage with expiration
- Authentication state validation on all task operations
- Automatic logout on session expiry
- Clear separation between authenticated and unauthenticated states

### User Experience Flow
1. **Landing State**: Clean login prompt with GitHub option
2. **Authentication**: Simple form with immediate feedback
3. **Main Application**: Full task management with user context
4. **Session Management**: Transparent handling of expiry and renewal

### Data Persistence Strategy
- Authentication state: Persistent in KV storage with expiry timestamp
- User tasks: Tied to authenticated session, cleared on logout
- User profile: Loaded from GitHub API during authentication

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios

**Session Expiry During Use**: Graceful handling with re-authentication prompt
**Failed Authentication**: Clear error messaging with retry options
**Network Issues**: Offline state handling and sync on reconnection
**Multiple Device Access**: Session management across different devices

## Accessibility & Security Standards
- WCAG AA compliance for all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation for complete authentication flow
- Screen reader support for security status updates
- Secure credential handling with no plaintext storage
