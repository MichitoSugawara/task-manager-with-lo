## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: The design should evoke trust, security, and personal control over data. Users should feel confident their information is protected while maintaining the clean, productive aesthetic of a modern task manager.

**Design Personality**: Premium, secure, and value-focused with clear payment status indicators and upgrade prompts that feel helpful rather than pushy.

**Visual Metaphors**: Premium badges, locked/unlocked states, and clear value propositions that communicate the benefits of upgrading.

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with blue accent tones to convey trust and security

**Primary Color**: Deep blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 250)) - conveys trustworthiness and security
**Secondary Colors**: Light blue-gray tones for supporting elements
**Accent Color**: Bright blue (oklch(0.55 0.2 280)) - for authentication CTAs and active states
**Security Colors**: Subtle red for logout/destructive actions, green for successful authentication

**Foreground/Background Pairings**:
- Primary text on background: oklch(0.25 0.1 250) on oklch(0.98 0.01 250) - 13.1:1 contrast ✓
- Primary button text: oklch(1 0 0) on oklch(0.45 0.15 250) - 8.7:1 contrast ✓
- Muted text: oklch(0.5 0.08 250) on oklch(0.98 0.01 250) - 5.2:1 contrast ✓

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varied weights for hierarchy
**Primary Font**: Inter - clean, readable, and professional
**Typographic Hierarchy**: 
- Headers: 600-700 weight for prominence
- Body: 400-500 weight for readability
- Captions: 400 weight with muted colors

### UI Elements & Component Selection
**Authentication Components**:
- Modal dialogs for login forms to maintain context
- Clear primary buttons for authentication actions
- GitHub integration button with recognizable branding
- User avatar and profile display in header

- Session status indicators (subtle)
- Authentication-gated action feedback

### Animations
**Authentication Flow**: Smooth transitions between login and main app states
**Security Feedback**: Subtle animations for successful/failed authentication
**Session Management**: Gentle notifications for session expiry

## Implementation Considerations

### Security Requirements
- Session tokens stored securely in KV storage with expiration
- Authentication state validation on all task operations
- Automatic logout on session expiry
- Clear separation between authenticated and unauthenticated states

### User Experience Flow
1. **Landing State**: Clean login prompt with GitHub option
2. **Authentication**: Simple form with immediate feedback
3. **Main Application**: Full task management with user context
4. **Session Management**: Transparent handling of expiry and renewal

### Data Persistence Strategy
- Authentication state: Persistent in KV storage with expiry timestamp
- User tasks: Tied to authenticated session, cleared on logout
- User profile: Loaded from GitHub API during authentication

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios

**Session Expiry During Use**: Graceful handling with re-authentication prompt
**Failed Authentication**: Clear error messaging with retry options
**Network Issues**: Offline state handling and sync on reconnection
**Multiple Device Access**: Session management across different devices

## Accessibility & Security Standards
